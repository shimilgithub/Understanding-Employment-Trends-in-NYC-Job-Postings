# Understanding Employment Trends in NYC Job Postings(Domain : People Analytics)

## Project Overview

### Background
In urban locations, particularly in places like New York, the job market encounters numerous obstacles,
including disparities in compensation, differences in demand for job roles, and the effect of residency regulations on employment openings. These elements may cause hiring procedures to be inefficient and deter job
seekers from pursuing their ideal positions.

Understanding these processes is crucial for policymakers and other stakeholders to address such workforce
gaps and enhance employment outcomes. They can make decisions and implement targeted interventions
by analyzing patterns and correlations in job posts to spot problems in real-time.

This is a data analysis and visualization project that deals with large scale data, addressess the below research questions and identifies the hidden patterns.

### Research Questions Addressed
1. Do different populations within similar job titles have observable salary differences?
2. What are the main wage distinctions between competitive job postings and those that are not?
3. Do residency requirements make some organizations more likely to have open positions?
4. Does the demography that is drawn to external postings differ from that of internal postings?
